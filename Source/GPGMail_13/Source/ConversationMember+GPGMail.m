    // Bug #981: Prevent Mail from loading any remote content if a message is encrypted
    //
    // A maliciously crafted email could otherwise exploit an error in Apple's mime parser
    // to exfiltrate the decrypted content, by using a non-closed HTML tag (for example img)
    // which is started in one mime part and continued in a different one, with a PGP/MIME
    // tree in between.
    // Once each mime part is processed, the single parts are concatenated and the decrypted
    // contents sent to the URL given in the img tag.
    // For more details see https://efail.de
    //
    // Mail internally calls updateBlockRemoteContent, which should already make sure
    // that remote content is blocked if -[MCMessageBody isEncrypted] returns YES. While
    // that should be the case for PGP messages already, re-check here.
    //
    // == NOTE FOR FUTURE LUKAS ==
    // In High Sierra, even if -[MUIWebDocument setBlockRemoteContent:YES] is called,
    // and remote content is available, the "load remote content" banner or the message
    // that remote content is available is not always displayed. After countless hours
    // of debugging it turns out that, remote content is cached by Mail or a
    // com.apple.WebKit.WebContent process invoked by Mail to display the mail contents,
    // which results in the following problematic behavior:
    //
    // 1.) If remote content was loaded once (even if in a different message) and was
    //     cached, each message which contains the same remote content (for example image)
    //     will display the image, regardless of whether the users allow to display
    //     remote content or not.
    // 2.) If all remote content of a message has already been cached,
    //     -[MUIWebDocument hasBlockedRemoteContent] might return NO, even if the user chose
    //     to block remote content and remote content is available in the message.
    //     It might however also return YES, if the document was rendered in a different
    //     com.apple.WebKit.WebContent process than the one, responsible for loading the
    //     remote content at first try.
    // 3.) The banner alerting users of the existence of remote content in a message
    //     and asking them if they want to load the remote content, relies upon
    //     -[MUIWebDocument hasBlockedRemoteContent] and will thus sometimes be displayed
    //     and sometimes not, based on the cache status of the remote content to be displayed.
    //
    // So Lukas, no, you were not losing your mind, Apple simply tried to fuck with you.
    // Lucky for us, since we don't want the load remote content banner to be displayed
    // for encrypted messages at all, we don't have to care about its faulty behavior,
    // but simply make sure, it is not displayed for encrypted messages.
