- Basically loads
- Symlinked bundles don't load -> Change install script in Xcode
- .gnupg can't be accessed, since it's not copied into /Users/lukele/Library/Containers/com.apple.mail/Data/

- gpg2 can't be run

  Dyld Error Message:
  Library not loaded: /usr/local/MacGPG2/lib/libintl.8.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/gpg2
  Reason: no suitable image found.  Did find:

  Fix with XPC?

  Relevant: https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingXPCServices.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/10000172i-SW6

  XPC does work, but needs to be installed inside /Applications/Mail.app/Contents/XPCServices for now.

  Takes kind of a long time to respond -> maybe use send_message_reply_sync?
