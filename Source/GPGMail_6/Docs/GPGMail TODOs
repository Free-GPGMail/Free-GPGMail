FOR 2.0
- How to identify a key for signing?
- If a key is used identified by the fingerprint, which email address
  is displayed in the signature view if the key has multiple uids
  for different email addresses?
- Fix compose interface when Priority field is enabled (GPG checkbox not visible)
- Fix compose interface when in customizing mode.

AFTER 2.0
- Implement a ui element which allows to choose the key used for signing
  (taking into consideration keys sharing the same email address,
   or uids sharing the same email address but different names.)
- Same for encrypting key
