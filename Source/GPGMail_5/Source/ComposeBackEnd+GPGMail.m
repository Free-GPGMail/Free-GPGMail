 makeMessageWithContents:isDraft:shouldSign:shouldEncrypt:shouldSkipSignature:shouldBePlainText: sets the encrpyt and sign flags

 Our workaround forces drafts to be encrypted and/or signed by disabling the draft setting.
 The problem is, while that works for normal IMAP accounts, it doesn't for GMail, which creates a new message for each

 We hook into this message, to force the draft setting to be on for drafts, AFTER the encrypt and sign flags are set.
 This way, the messages remain actual drafts, and GMail is satisfied as well and behaves as it should.

 The problem is, while that works for normal IMAP accounts, it doesn't for GMail, which creates a new message for each
 draft if "Store drafts on server" is activated.
 We hook into this message, to force the draft setting to be on for drafts, AFTER the encrypt and sign flags are set.
 This way, the messages remain actual drafts, and GMail is satisfied as well and behaves as it should.
 
 On Mavericks the method is called: newOutgoingMessageUsingWriter:contents:headers:isDraft:shouldBePlainText:
 On (Mountain)Lion the method is called: outgoingMessageUsingWriter:contents:headers:isDraft:shouldBePlainText:
 
 GMCodeInjector makes sure, that the correct method is overridden by our own.
