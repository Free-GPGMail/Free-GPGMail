GPGMail
=======

GPGMail is a plugin for OS X's Mail.app, which let's you  
send and receive secure, OpenPGP encrypted and signed messages.

GPGMail currently doesn't support macOS Sierra (10.12). We're actively working on it.

Localizations are done on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/GPGMail/).

Prerequisite
------------

In order to use GPGMail you need to have GnuPG installed.
You can either build your own version, use one from [homebrew](http://brew.sh) or find a packaged version for OS X at [gpgtools.org](https://gpgtools.org)

Build
-----

#### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/GPGTools/GPGMail.git
cd GPGMail
```

#### Grab Dependencies

In order to communicate with GnuPG we use our own Objective-C framework called [Libmacgpg](https://github.com/GPGTools/Libmacgpg).
It's necessary to clone the Libmacgpg repository first, before building GPGMail.

```bash
cd Dependencies
git clone https://github.com/GPGTools/Libmacgpg.git
cd ..
```

#### Build
```bash
make
```

#### Install
Copy Libmacgpg.framework from Dependencies/Libmacgpg/build/Release/ to ~/Library/Frameworks.

After that copy the GPGMail.mailbundle file from build/Releases/GPGMail.mailbundle to ~/Libray/Mail/Bundles, re-start Mail.app and enjoy.
